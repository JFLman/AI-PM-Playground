# Roadmap: AI Meeting Notes Summarizer

A phased plan to develop and launch the AI Meeting Notes Summarizer.

## Phase 1: Concept & Prototype (1-2 Weeks)
- Define MVP: Summarize text notes into 3-5 bullet points.
- Build prototype using an existing NLP API (e.g., OpenAI or Hugging Face).
- Test with sample notes from 3-5 mock meetings.
- Success: Summaries capture >80% of key points.

## Phase 2: User Testing & Refinement (3-4 Weeks)
- Recruit 5 beta users (e.g., managers or peers).
- Add audio input via speech-to-text (e.g., Google API).
- Iterate based on feedbackâ€”improve accuracy and brevity.
- Success: Users save >20 mins/week; satisfaction >4/5.

## Phase 3: Integration & Launch (6-8 Weeks)
- Integrate with tools like Slack or Zoom for seamless input.
- Add export options (PDF, Markdown).
- Launch to a small team and measure adoption.
- Success: 50+ active users; retention >70% after 1 month.

## Future Ideas
- Real-time summarization during live meetings.
- Sentiment analysis to flag team morale issues.
