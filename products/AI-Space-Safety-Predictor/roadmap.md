Phase 1: MVP Development (4-6 Weeks)
- Build ML model to predict failures using historical telemetry data.
- Integrate with one vehicle system (e.g., propulsion).
- Test with simulated flight data.
- Success: >85% accuracy in failure prediction.

Phase 2: Real-Time Integration (6-8 Weeks)
- Enable real-time telemetry analysis for live missions.
- Add space weather data integration.
- Pilot with one XYZ Space Technology test flight.
- Success: Identify >80% of potential risks in real-time; user satisfaction >4/5.

Phase 3: Scale and Collaboration (8-10 Weeks)
- Expand to all vehicle systems (e.g., life support, navigation).
- Launch collaborative dashboard for cross-functional teams.
- Deploy across XYZ Space Technology fleet.
- Success: Reduce mission risks by 50%; adoption by 90% of teams.

Future Ideas
- Predictive maintenance scheduling for reusable components.
- Integration with lunar or orbital habitat systems.
