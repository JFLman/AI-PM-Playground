## Potential Risks
- Prediction Errors: False positives/negatives could disrupt missions.
- Data Overload: High-volume telemetry may overwhelm processing.
- Stakeholder Misalignment: Engineering vs. safety priorities may conflict.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Prediction Errors: Use ensemble models; conduct weekly validation with 50+ historical cases.
- Data Overload: Optimize Kafka with load balancing; scale AWS instances dynamically.
- Stakeholder Misalignment: Host bi-weekly syncs with KPIs; present A/B test results to align goals.
