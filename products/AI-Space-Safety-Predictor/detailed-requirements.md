## Functional Requirements
- Analyze telemetry data to predict failures within 30 seconds.
- Recommend up to 5 preventive actions per alert with confidence scores.
- Integrate with space weather APIs (e.g., NOAA) for environmental risk assessment.
- Provide a dashboard with role-based access for mission control, engineering, and safety teams.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Process 10,000 data points/second.
- Accuracy: >90% prediction accuracy after Phase 2.
- Security: Encrypt all telemetry data; comply with aerospace standards.

## Tech Stack (Hypothetical)
- ML: TensorFlow for predictive models
- Real-Time Processing: Apache Kafka for telemetry streaming
- APIs: NOAA Space Weather API for environmental data
- Dashboard: React for frontend, AWS for hosting
