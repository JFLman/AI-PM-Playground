## Potential Risks
- Misclassification: AI mislabels urgent emails, causing missed deadlines.
- Privacy Concerns: Users worry about email data security.
- Integration Issues: Calendar API failures disrupt scheduling.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Misclassification: Implement user feedback loop; retrain model weekly.
- Privacy: Use end-to-end encryption; comply with GDPR/CCPA.
- Integration: Build fallback mechanisms (e.g., manual scheduling prompts).
