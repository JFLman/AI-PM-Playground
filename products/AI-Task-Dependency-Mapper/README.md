# AI Task Dependency Mapper

## Overview
A tool that maps task dependencies in projects, predicts bottlenecks, and optimizes workflows.

## Problem Statement
Project managers struggle to visualize task dependencies, leading to delays and inefficiencies.

## Proposed Solution
An AI system that:
- Parses project tasks from tools like Jira or Trello.
- Uses graph-based ML to map dependencies.
- Predicts bottlenecks with historical data and ML.
- Suggests optimal task sequences for faster delivery.

## Target Users
- Project managers
- Software development teams
- Agile practitioners

## Tech Stack (Hypothetical)
- **Graph ML**: PyTorch Geometric for dependency mapping
- **APIs**: Jira, Trello APIs for task data
- **Prediction**: Time-series ML for bottleneck forecasting
